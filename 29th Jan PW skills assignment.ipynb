A car has certain properties or characteristics such as make, model, year, color, and it also has certain behaviors or actions like accelerating, braking, and changing gears. Similarly, an object in OOP has properties or data, and it also has methods or functions that can manipulate that data."

    "Quesion 3 - Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer - Again with the help of chatGPGT i got to know what identifiers are and their types. This really helped me understand it in a summarized way.\n",
    "\n",
    "So First lets understand what Identifiers are - \n",
    "\n",
    "An identifier is a name that is used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or any other user-defined object. An identifier is a sequence of letters, digits, and underscores (_), and it must begin with a letter or an underscore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example- 'pw_skills' , 'Pwskills' are example of Identifiers in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, an identifier is a name given to a variable, function, class, or any other user-defined object in Python. It helps to identify and distinguish between different objects in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most common types of identifiers are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Camel Case: The first letter of each word is capitalized, except the first word. For example: 'myPwSkillsClass'\n",
    "\n",
    "Pascal Case: The first letter of each word is capitalized, including the first word. For example: 'MyPwSkillsClass'\n",
    "\n",
    "Snake Case: All letters are lowercase, and words are separated by underscores. For example: 'my_pwskills_class'\n",
    "\n",
    "Upper Case: All letters are uppercase. For example: 'MY_PWSKILLS_CLASS'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While exploring this - I also got to undertand what (\"variable, function, class, module, or any other user-defined object\") these terms mean with example.Explaining below - \n",
    "\n",
    "Variable: A variable is a named storage location in your code that holds a value, such as a number or a string.\n",
    "my_variable = 5\n",
    "my_name = \"pwskills\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Function: A function is a named block of code that performs a specific task or calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rest of them function class module I couldn't undertsand from CHATGPT as they are not yet covered by Sudhanshu In class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SUMMARY - Yes, Python is case sensitive when dealing with identifiers. This means that the uppercase and lowercase letters are considered distinct and separate.\n",

    "\n",
    "I understood the concept of Compiled or Interpreted with the help of a very good and relatable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming languages like Python and C++, we need to convert our code into a form that computers can understand. There are two ways to do this: compilation and interpretation. Compilation is like baking a cake and giving it to someone to eat. You write the recipe once, convert it into a cake, and then distribute the cake to others. Interpreted languages like Python are like reading the recipe out loud and baking the cake at the same time. Every time you want to bake the cake, you read the recipe out loud and make the cake. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language. This is different from compiled languages like C or C++ or Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we don't have to worry about compiling our code because the interpreter takes care of it for us. we just write  code and run it, and the interpreter does the rest. When we run a Python program, the interpreter reads the code line by line and executes it. The standard Python interpreter is the command-line interface (CLI) called \"python\"\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are tools like PyInstaller and Py2exe that allows package the Python code into an executable file if we need to distribute the code to users who don't have Python installed on their machines.\n",
